	<div class="specificTitle">Changes</div>
	Changes to the Privacy Policy apply to your use of our Services after the “effective date.” 1oh1 (“we” or “us”) can modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may close your account.

It’s your choice to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.

	<div class="specificTitle">Contact and Calendar Information</div>
	We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts or calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests).

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">1.3 Service Use</div>
	We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, apps and platform technology (e.g., our off-site plugins), such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies</div>
	As further described in our Cookies Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different Services and devices. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. You can also opt-out from our use of cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for third party advertising.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">1.5 Your Device and Location</div>
	When you visit or leave our Services (including our plugins or cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to next. We also get information about your IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, and/or ISP or your mobile carrier. If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">1.6 Messages</div>
	We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our Services. For example, if you get a 1oh1 schedule request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use automatic scanning technology on messages.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">1.7 Sites and Services of Others</div>
	We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with 1oh1 or visit others’ services that include our plugins, ads, cookies or similar technologies.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">1.8 Other</div>
	Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we use your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitle">2. How We Use Your Data</div>
	How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, our Services (including ads) so that they can be more relevant and useful to you and others.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.1 Services</div>
	<div class="specificTitle">Stay Connected</div>
	Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with other site users. To do so, you will “Favorite” with the user who you choose, and who also wish to “Favorite” you. Subject to your settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange other opportunities.
	We will use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest favorites for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with). <br><br>
	It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services or send a favorite request. When you invite someone to join, or favorite another user, your invitation will include your name, photo, network and contact information. We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of favorites with your connections.
	<div class="specificTitle">Stay Informed</div>
	Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to recommend relevant content and conversations on our Services, suggest skills you may have to add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by having a session in that area), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or watch related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and picture, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, took social action, added a new favorite or joined a new project. 
	<div class="specificTitle">Productivity</div>
	Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. 

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.2 Communications</div>
	We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your 1oh1 inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use the Services, network updates, reminders, and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication preferences at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.3 Advertising</div>
	We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;<br>
	Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, interests, skills);<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, favorites, participation, page visits, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• Information from advertising partners and publishers and <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender). <br><br>
	We will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled “ads” or “sponsored.” If you take an action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads.

	<div class="specificTitle">Ad Choices</div>
	We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self-regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads.
	<div class="specificTitle">Info to Ad Providers</div>
	We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for their advertising except for: (i) hashed or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g. profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our site or apps, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may through the use of mechanisms such as cookies determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.4 Marketing</div>
	We use data and content about Members for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.5 Developing Services and ResearchService Development</div>
	We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for the further development of our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
	<div class="specificTitle">Surveys</div>
	Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. 

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.6 Customer Support</div>
	We use the data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and Service issues (e.g., bugs).

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.7 Aggregate Insights</div>
	We use your data to produce and share aggregated insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our members to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or demographic insights.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.8 Security and Investigations</div>
	We use your data (including your communications) if we think it’s necessary for security purposes or to investigate possible fraud or other violations of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy and/or attempts to harm our Members or Visitors.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitle">3. How We Share Information</div>

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">3.1 Our Services</div>

	<div class="specificTitle">Profile</div>
	Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search engines). Your settings, favorites, skills and interests, impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
	<div class="specificTitle">Posts, Ratings, Follows, Comments, Messages</div>
	Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, ratings, follows and comments. <br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• When you share a project (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere. Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and a photo if you have provided one).<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• When you rate or comment on a project or a Member the rating and comments will be publicly available for other users to view. 
	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">3.2 Others’ Services</div>
	Subject to your settings, other services may look-up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. You may revoke the link with such accounts.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">3.3 Related Services</div>
	We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">3.4 Service Providers</div>
	We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">3.5 Legal Disclosures</div>
	It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal processes or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you, (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (4) protect the security or integrity of our Service (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitle">4. Your Choices & Obligations</div>

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">4.1 Data Retention</div>
	We retain your personal data while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open until you decide to close your account.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data</div>
	We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. <br>
	For personal data that we have about you: <br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;• You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held). <br>

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">4.3 Account Closure</div>
	If you choose to close your 1oh1 account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.
	We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
	Information you have shared with others (e.g., through the messaging app, updates or project posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitle">5. Other Important Information</div>

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">5.1. Security</div>
	We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">5.2. Cross-Border Data Transfers</div>
	We process data both inside and outside of Canada and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">5.3 Lawful Bases for Processing</div>
	We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the 1oh1 Services you have requested)) and “legitimate interests”.
	Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">5.4. Direct Marketing and Do Not Track Signals</div>
	We currently do not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your permission.

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">5.5. Contact Information</div>
