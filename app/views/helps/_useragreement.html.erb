    “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if the law requires that you must be older in order for 1oh1 to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such an older age.

    Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections) and (4) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and 1oh1 Professional Community Policies You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.<br>
    As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.



	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.3 Payment</div>
    If you buy any of our paid Services you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:<br>
    <ul> 
        <li>Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).</li> 
        <li>We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.</li> 
        <li>If you purchase a subscription, your payment method will automatically be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date.</li>

	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">2.5 Sharing</div>
    When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.<br>
    Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, slide decks, links to news articles, job postings, InMails and blogs. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your address, sharing content only to 1oh1 connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your 1oh1 profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So if you apply for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.<br>
    We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.


	<div class="sectionLegalSubtitleXS">3. Rights and Limits</div>

These rights are limited in the following ways:<br>
    <ul>
        1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied, re-shared it or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.<br>
        2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content).

        3. We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your content beyond the Services. However, if you choose to share your post as "public", we will enable a feature that allows other Members to embed that public post onto third-party services, and we enable search engines to make that public content findable though their services.
        4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.<br>
